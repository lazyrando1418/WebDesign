        <strong>Destiny</strong>"Destiny," developed by Bungie, is a sci-fi action-packed multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) game that blends elements of role-playing games (RPGs) and MMOs (massively multiplayer online games). Set in a mythic science fiction world, players take on the role of Guardians, wielding incredible powers to protect Earth's last safe city from various alien races and threats. On a personal note, this game has consumed me and i can whole hartedly recomend it if you have lots of hours to kill.
